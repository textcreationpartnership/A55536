            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The pious Life and Death of M<seg rend="sup">R.</seg> IOSIAH SHVTE Who left us on the 22. day of <hi>June.</hi> 1643.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Arewell to my teares, I'le weepe no more; let those that can finde no other expressions for their griefe, than what their showring eyes afford them, bewaile our departed Prophet in a silent language of a teare, and weepe out E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legies for their soules great losse. I must finde out some other meanes to empty my full bosome; not that I would willingly part with the remembrance of our <hi>Iosiah,</hi> nor poure out all the sad thoughts his death hath left, for even my melancholy is welcome to me, whilst he is the subject of it, but I would transcribe some reverentiall conceipt which my contemplative griefe hath written on my heart, that may perhaps be better read on my paper, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me they have now a confused method, and take up so much of me, that they scarce leave roome for other thoughts, which the times fruitfulnesse and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious debate doe continually dictate to me. I may freely admire thee now, for thy modest eares are deafe to our applauses, and thy well-bred life was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our flattery, so that I shall have no cause to checke my selfe, whilst with praise and wonder I runne over the verity of thy merit: neither shall our
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53339:2"/> inquirie beginne at the last act of thy life, wee will cursorily at least examine every Sceane of it, and will looke backe even from thy cradle to thy grave, and we shall finde thee consecrated even from thy infancy to the service of thy great Master; thou wast the sonne of a Prophet, of a religious and faithfull Minister, who was blessed with five more, every one of which with a carefull and pious hand he lead through all their studies, till he brought them from the Schoole to the Pulpit: and when as in eminent Candlesticsts hee had there placed them, as so many burning and flaming Lights, as there wanted no worth to make him perspicuously happy but heaven it selfe, he left this world enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to him for those happy Legacies in a full age.</p>
            <p>We will not here any further search after the religious courses of thy pious Brothers, yet while we bemoane thee, we cannot but lament the considerable losse of thy neighbour-Brother, who was fainted some few yeers before thee, whose various Learning, whose devout industry, whose divine gifts, made his life also admired, and his death lamented of all that heard of him, being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as well to thy desert as blood.</p>
            <p>When we take a view of thee, and examine all thy merit, we need no other description of a true Father of the Church, and a true Protestant, and let those who shall hereafter have occasion to write such a Character, remember reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend <hi>Shute,</hi> and make him their patterne.</p>
            <p>We will first consider him as a man, how well he did instruct himselfe, and preach to his owne soule, and we shall here finde that his ordinary conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was a continued Lecture.</p>
            <p>He was of a disposition sociable, and affording Nature onely such refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as might enable her to assist him in his holy imployments, for they were but as so many preparatives for study. To all he was generally affable, to none severe, never discovering any austerity but against an impudent sinner. He was knowne almost to all, acquainted but with a few: he kept a civill correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with many learned men, but those that he chiefly bestowed his leasure houres with, he chose rather for their free and innocent friendlinesse, than for any eminency of their parts, rather studying bookes than men, yet conversing with the best, that he might not quite be a stranger to the times he lived in. His greatest wealth was the riches of content, his greatest expence (next to his Books) was his charitie: he could never finde himselfe toucht with any thing like covetousnesse, but when his small treasure could not afford reliefe for some that were the objects of his pitty.</p>
            <p>He was long happy in a vertuous Wife, but never was a Father, though he <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n shewed himselfe so to those that were fatherlesse. He knew not how to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53339:2"/> be proud, and could as ill indure a corrupting flattery. In briefe, he was of so caven a spirit, so happily tempered, that hee was master of his passions, and had no unruly humour predominant in him. I could lay downe out of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of his life, so many divine, so many morall rules and precepts, that his very example were direction enough how we should stere our actions and affections; but these are the slightest pieces of his worth.</p>
            <p>Let us look upon him in his proper sphere, and inquire how fit a man hee for his sacred function, how he was quallified to be an Ambassadour from the Court of heaven, and how he might be well worth our wonder, for it will appeare that all the eminencies which doe disperse and divide themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst severall other men did meet in him, what was it that any one man of his profession might boast off, which he was not master off; his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and preaching countenance did chastise every carelesse and wanton hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, so that to weare his picture neer our eye or heart, or to suppose him look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us, were enough methinks to fright away a sinfull thought; devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hovered about him, when he was addressing himselfe to pray, and his whole gesture held a warme zeale even in a frozen bosome, whilst his piercing words fell from him they begat private sighs in those which joyned with him, to witnesse that their hearts breathed out the same requests, all his ejaculations were the sober dictates of the spirit, they were not fierce nor sudden raptures huddled up, conceived, and borne in a hasty minute; his zeale though fervent was modestly ordered considering to whom he spake, nor did he on the other side tye himselfe to a few set words, as if the Almighty were to be appeased with spells, but well fitted Petitions varied as often as any occasion offered themselves; and when he had as it were prepared the attentive soule by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and begged a blessing upon his houres discourse; he so cheerfully, so sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly addressed himselfe to the work of a heavenly Creator, that he presently had possession of our eyes eares and hearts, he seldome (unlesse some other occasion called for it) varied his text, or leaped from place to place to start a new Subject, he commonly preached one piece of Scripture with such learned perspicuity, such a pious pleasancie, and did so heighten our religious appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites that we were sorry for the parting sands, and languished for the next houre to finish that which to day he had perhaps but only cut out, and divide for another dayes exercise; in his delivery he was neither affected nor loose, having such a command of his tongue and voyce, that he could handsomely fit them for every Subject: at a funerall he preached so powerfully in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of death, that he made some desirous not to live, others to live better; nor did any returne from him without beneficiall conviction of their owne
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53339:3"/> mortality, so pathetically would he solemnize the passion of our Saviour, that his hearers might well laugh at the superstition of a crucifix, which only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the Gazers eye, or but slightly toucheth the abused soule, when as he imprinted in every heart Christ crucified, by representing every circumstance of his Passion; and so to the life, as if he were bleeding afresh, and were again stabbed and wounded by us that were his sinfull Auditory, by those meanes he became master of our consciences, which stood in awe of his words, and were powerfully subdued to his saving doctrines, nor did he administer sharp things only, he had balme for the broken and contrite heart, soft and gentle perswasions to awe a trembling soule, he never denounced judgement but his eyes were big with teares, he was none of those thunderers who represent God in all his terrible attributes and shadow over his mercy and compassion. He rather allured then terrified a straying conscience, and rather endeavoured to bring it home to the Fold then drive it farther from safety, and though he did dresse his Ministery with all the winning advantages and pious allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of spirituall Rhetorick, though the weeds he cloathed it in were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broadered with all the faculties of learning, with golden Sentences, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Meditations, which did catch the attentions of every Auditour. Yet this <hi>Kings Daughter</hi> (for so is the word well preached) was all glorious within, the matter which was the inside was rich and substantiall, those whose capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties went along with him understandingly might receive instruction to their soules comfort, so well did he complye with the meanest hearer; The more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate apprehension of the Nobility and Gentry, (which was still part of that religious Auditory) was so advisedly suted, that he did as it were court them from their sinnes and by a holy insinuation did even steale into their bosomes: and so powerfully convince them of their vanitie, that they alwayes carryed home with them new resolutions; and the most sober, the most learned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (for some such were almost alwayes part of his Auditory) discovered in every Sermon such a digesture of generall learning so many full expressions of a Schollar, of a sound Preacher, of a holy man, that they could have even kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Pulpit in approbation of those blessed Truths sent down from it.</p>
            <p>There might you see the graver Divines, willing to improve their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and their piety by that summary duty which might be found in every dayes Lecture; and there might be seen the young men of the Cassock lately set up in their Trade for soules, inabling themselves for their sacred imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so attentively fixing their whole soules on him, as if they had a desire to assimulate themselves to every excellency of his; and eying of him as if they were learning to put on his reverend gesture which gave life to all that fell
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53339:3"/> from him, the other how to borrrow his unaffected art and faculty of utterance, another how to weave his reading and meditation with such cunning and advantage to his owne soule, that he might be able to communicate the benefit received thereby to others of that holy Function; another carefully observing his method, in purpose to revive his after-Labours by so rare a Modell. Thus hee was a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident for all men, yet was there such a mixture of holinesse in all these perfections, as if hee onely had beene ignorant of them. And wonder not that this Tower of <hi>David</hi> made so faire a shew, and so many dwelling eminences; for he had a foundation large and faire, Grace layed the first stone, and perseverance built upon it; a connexion of piety and good works was the Morter and Cement, Faith was the Butteresse, the holy Spirit was the Master-wheele, by whose divine influence every thing was disposed; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lent all her ayde to make the work perfect, for, (is so many La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers whose proper imployments were herein necessary) shee sent an open imposition, a retentive memory, a searching wit, a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judgement; and here were all the sorts of Art which makes the superstructure, as indefatigable industry, inquisitive study, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous observation, satisfying experience, and the usefull extractions of books and antiquities.</p>
            <p>Let it bee the boast of others, that they are able to performe the most sacred Ministeriall Office, without being much behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to learning (that necessary hand maid to divine knowledge) whilst we pitty, and laugh at the ignorance of those zealous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; it will be worthy admiration to his lasting fame, that he was not content to make himselfe intimate with the whole Scripture, and have every Text ready to confute an Adversary, or convince a Sinner, but he did runne over the whole body of Learning; sip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from every part of it, as from so many flowers some servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble notions, which being by his holy Art digested, as by the subtle Chimistrie of the Bee, helped to make up that honey, the sweet
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53339:4"/> and cordiall Lectures which he frequently entertained us.</p>
            <p>Hee read the Bible in that originall Language, in which the happy Secretaries to the holy Ghost pend it, that hee might bee the more flowing with the true intention of every word and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presson of it; making himselfe acquainted with those learned languages, because hee would looke back into the first essence and purity of things, before the perplexing variety of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conceipt had speckt it selfe upon it; that hee might exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine upon what grounds and reasons, the ancient Expositors, and Fathers, have founded the numerous volumes, which at this day doe furnish our Libraries; doing this not out of a proud curiosity, or to defend errour: but out of a reverend feare of assenting to their new opinions of any how well soever esteemed, if he find them dissonant to their ancient verities, which he studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously attained too by going so farre backward into the unfailed learning, and wisdome, which was behind him.</p>
            <p>But I'le summe up no more of his parts, but will abruptly leave his many abilities in the mid way; seeing every Sermon of his told us how generally, how admirably, he was qualified (for they were not the elaborate issues of many dayes, so much time not being allowed him) but they were the digested Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tescence of his former labours, to which his leisure onely gave him leave to adde a little else, but meditation and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>
            <p>There is yet something behind, which will give more lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre to his precious memory; it is possible wee may finde his parallell, if wee relye upon his qualifications of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and strong parts; but where shall wee finde so much integrity, one so like those faithfull Disciples, whose im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Tutour Christ himselfe was, one that so deservedly may bee stiled an Apostle of Christ, by his prime Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies. Let us first looke upon him as approved of by his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53339:4"/> great Master, to take care of those soules, amongst whome hee expired; behaving himselfe much like that Shepheard, that gave his life for his sheepe; for it is well knowne, hee spent himselfe so without intermission in his study and his Pulpit, that his unstinted houres, which wanted part of that immoderate exercise, which his Spirits had setled into diseases: which pressed upon him so violently in his latter yeeres, that he often preached in paine, in faint sweats, nay, sometimes in blood, of which he had many witnesses; nor could he be wonne from his Station wherein his conscience told him God had set him, by any richer invitations, or Livings offered him by his friends of a greater value, which he often refused. When he had brought his neighbours soule halfe way to heaven, to leave them to a new Convoy, who might rather direct them in a crooked course, or bring them back againe, then help them forward (for he would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the paucity of conscientious Guides) hee was alwayes so farre from that almost Epidemicall crime of temporising, that hee was lookt upon as a perfect Antagonist to the time hee lived in, as if hee had scorn'd to bee a Favourite to that predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant power, under which the evills hee lamented, received their continuance and growth. His well-setled soule, was still kept within its religious Center, and could never bee cojured out by all their powerfull Charmes which ambition scatters, to invei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle the opinions and judgements of her opposites. When at any time hee saw any indirect designes on foot, which some great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents in Church and State kept going, either to put more setters upon the Subjects, or new designes on Religion; hee would never bee courted to bawde his tongue to make Apologies for their Innovations, nor could bee silenced from declaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the dangerous attempts of the first Troublers of <hi>Israel,</hi> and there needes no greater Conviction of the corrupt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of those dayes; that hee, and some men of his forme
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53339:5"/> were so long left unpreferred, whilst the dignities of the Church (which should have beene the reward of men singular for their piety and ability) were taken up by such, who rather studied and practised the politicks then duty.</p>
            <p>And when afterwards the winds were quite turned, when stormes and foule weather threatned every one that came into the new Rodes, he did not forsake the Anchor of a holy resolution, but rather indured sharp blasts of envie and malice, disdaining a wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring compliancy to the fatall alterations of our giddy times, which drew from him many a teare, and private groane; neither could hee refraine from a more open expression of his griefe, though there were danger in his very sighs, because they seemed to thwart the affections of such, as were hurried another way by their owne violencie; hee would modestly complaine of the miscarriage of those above him, and with a warme and warrantable zeale, be angry with such among the giddy people, who would not for the confusion they were headlong running into; no bold face sinner could escape him without a reasonable reprehension, no destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive doctrines, no false glosses, no schismaticall tares could be sowed by the malice or ignorance of any, but hee would carefully set himselfe to the weeding them out betime, least the seed of them should prove fruitfull, and scatter themselves in his well-kept Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, (for such is a parish well instructed) hee was so true a lover of Vnion and true Devotion, that the dividing Separatist, and suspitious Papist's received a wound from him, at almost every Lecture.</p>
            <p>To conclude, he was a furious and eager Opposite to all those things that interrupted our Peace, and sullies the face of Truth; that we must needs complaine that Truth and Peace have lost their chiefe Champion.</p>
            <p>Neither did he encounter the enemies of the times with a loud voyce, but moderately and calmely overthrew them; having
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53339:5"/> learned the breaking of a flint with much easinesse upon a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, scorning that vaine glory, and the servile ends which makes some partially and uncivilly raise against the present mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charriages, ssmply on purpose to anger the power of those, whose interest commands them to stop their mouthes, that they may undeservedly g<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ine the title of a prerogative Martyr, and hazard their preferments in expectation of some better Guardian. So reaching at a dignity by their hot ambition; which they were never likely to reach by their luke-warme devotion. But his divine soule knew no indirect ends, the Cathedrall honour, had never any magnetick influence; upon his conscience, his eyes, and his heart, were alwayes towards heaven; as if from thence hee expected a Bishoprick, and desired no other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, then what was there layed up for him, being so straight minded, that he sleighted the Miter to make himselfe sure of a Crowne.</p>
            <p>It is time, that I should make hast to his mortality, least when I have inquired after, and called together all his worth, some may think him more then a man.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore looke upon his declining, and wee shall finde an Evening becoming such a day, glorious even in his Sun-set, neither could wee looke for any other Catastrophee at the last Sceane, when all the rest of his life was so well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; Hee lived fifty five yeares to learne how to dye well (for indeed his whole Age was no otherwise imployed) at last, Nature being over-wrought, groaned under many infirmities, with which Conflict, hee a great while passed over; till death which could not bee deferred further, and heaven which could not longer bee without this Guest, agreed here to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon him by a sowning fit, which as soone as hee had retired out of his Pulpit into his Chamber, suspended his Spirits, and had throwne him on the ground; had not a lucky friend
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53339:6"/> (whose fortune it was to close his eyes at last) then by chance rescued him from the fall, after this, his disease pursued him so close, that it took him from his profession, and thus he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted death, even before death to be forced from his Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, there he interr'd himselfe willingly, and expired his soule, being then nearer, and on its way to heaven.</p>
            <p>But blessed man, thou madest thy bed thy Pulpit, and finding thy soule upon her wing, thou didst almost after thy usuall method, betake thy selfe to thy Text; which was, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Monasillable death, yet before thou didst enter u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it, thou didst prepare thy few and happy Auditours by a most devout and patheticall prayer, wherein all the world was beholding to thy extraordinary charity; and may thy bleeding Countrey, thy distressed Brethren, thy melancholly Friends, and even thy peevish e<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>emies feele the blessing which in thy last words thou didst begge for them; when thou hadst, as if thou didst intend them, so many Legacies, summed up all things which were necessary for us, thou didst bequeath thy soule into the hands of him that made thee, and suddenly after didst fall asleep, hee that shall with a contemplative soule observe all this, and yet want a Sermon to teach him how to dye well; when Reverend SHUTE now, very neare a Saint preached, from his death-bed to him will hardly bee brought to a sence of saving mortification; should his blessed Angell descend, and bring downe instructions more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from Gods mouth, how he must dye, to live immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally.</p>
            <p>Nor did this man of God goe to his grave with more fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, he had more true mourners, then follow the Herse of a departed Prince; such put an affected griefe, with their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled blacknesse: and at these stately Obsequies, there is no circumstance like sorrow but a contrite solitarinesse; when
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53339:6"/> as here wanted no Pagets of mortality, nor borrowed Sadues to attend him to the house of death in his melancholy Traine, (which was made up of thousands besides his drooping kindred, it was hard to finde out a drye eye or face, wherein griefe did not apparently shew it selfe.</p>
            <p>The Nobility and Gentrie could not but command their teares, or were willing to bestow that Courtfull showre, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the many blessings they derived from him, the dejected Clergy hung downe their heads, as if they had lost the credit of their profession; his sad Parishioners, who for so many yeeres had received the bread of life by his faithfull Ministery, looked pale and disconsolate, as though they had feared a succeeding famine; and the rest of the weeping crowde who had heretofore gathered up, whilst he shook the Tree of life to all that came, by their lamentations and plenteous sighs, did witnesse that they had soules sensible of the injury which death had done them by taking away him, who alwayes stood Centinell for all his Auditors, and gave them a timely Allarum against the surprisall of their Arch-enemy the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</p>
            <p>Well then, might his learned friend have spared his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Lecture, for there were no eyes present which needed pumping, no hearts which were not already melted at the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of this Faviourite, but his words were cordiall to us, when hee excellently shewed us, how hee had fought a good fight, finished his course, and kept the faith, and was gone to receive that Crowne of Righteousnesse, which the Lord the righteous Iudge had laid up for him.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore wipe our eyes, seeing wee are so well assured of his happinesse, least wee seeme to envie him in his blessed repose, and the reward of his righteousnesse, to hope it is as certaine, as that the Almighty is mercifull, and that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53339:7"/> hee hath prepared for him a Kingdome and Crowne of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>
            <p>Yet, it is said there wants not those that dare more then doubt of his soules blisse; O desperate uncharitablenesse, even against their owne soules.</p>
            <p>If our God bee so severe, that the well-drest soule which never went without its true judgement cannot bee admitted, what shall become of those, who have nothing but ragges of vanity, and paths of pretended zeale to cloath their sinfull na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse.</p>
            <p>O my God, if there bee no roome in heaven for this good, this vigilant shepheard: where shall the poore flocke bee folded, when wee are driven out of this life; Is not the gate of blessednesse narrow enough, but must wretched men strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it yet further, if so much, so pure piety cannot enter, how shall prophanesse and accumulated sinne struggle thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that forward intruder, that will make himselfe of Gods Iury, and dare peremptorily condemne the just and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, passes a severe sentence against his owne soule.</p>
            <p>But heaven and earth whose darling hee alwayes was, have listed him above the reach of their violent malice, and will ere long take some revenge for his injury, and whilst God and man having now divided him betwixt them, shall take care the one of his soule, the other of his Fame, and shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternize him in the Register of the Saints: when the memory of those dragges of men who are professed enemies to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and learning, unto piety, and almost to all the true and essentiall parts of Charity and Religion, shall bee odious to posterity, to which they have given a wound, to their furious and unlimited zeale and practice, which will scarce bee well car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed by many succeeding Ages; Yet even for those malignant Spirits his soule left a Blessing: whilst he beg'd of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53339:7"/> (whether he was about to goe) to enlighten and amend their blind-fold eyes, and to pardon their wilfull and malitious blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Thus instead of repaying the gall of his detractors with bitternesse, he took them into his prayers, and so sacrificed for their sinnes, a benefit bestowed upon them against their will and merit.</p>
            <p>Come hither then all ye that have an ayme to heaven, and set your selves to study the life and death of this holy man. What wee cannot performe by his precepts and pious instructions, let us reach at by his example and imitation, thus he may live with us in despight of death, and preach saving doctrines, though he be for ever silenced, thus every godly bosome may make it selfe his Tombe, which being adorned with any resemblance of his better part, will more fully evidence his worth: then a shining Marble, where partiall Inscriptions doe most times flatter their dead Guests; and are therefore justly suspected as no more then a Funerall complement. Yet it were both pitty and ingratitude, we should tempt them who hath so often awaked us from our sinfull Lethurgy, before we had huddled him up in the common dust, without some memoriall where it is laid up.</p>
            <p>Goe on then, and you whose soules were above thirty yeares obleiged to him, deliver him up to be inter'd in your intended Monument, that when aged Time hath worne out all those who have been witnesses of his worth, his parts and piety, those stones may tell his happy story, by offering his Epitaph to every Reader.</p>
